# github-api-search
A app to search a Github user/organisation, list their repositories, and then filter/sort them using React, Redux and Webpack.

Contains:

* a working example of a search form, and filterable table of a Github user's/organisation's repositories.
* ES6 - 7 Support with Babel.
* Redux dev tools to help you keep track of the app's state (install the Chrome plugin).
* Hot module replacement support so you can change modules or react components without having to reload the browser.
* a webpack production config so you can build the app and make it ready for production
* Sass support.
* eslint to keep your js readable.

## Run the app

0. ```git clone the repo```
0. ```cd into the folder```
0. ```yarn```
